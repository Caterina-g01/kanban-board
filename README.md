# Kanban Board

This Kanban board is built using **React.js** and **Vite**, providing a smooth and responsive user experience for task management. The board consists of four distinct columns:

- **Backlog**: Tasks that require clarification before being taken into work.
- **Ready**: Tasks that are ready to be picked up and worked on.
- **In Progress**: Tasks currently being worked on.
- **Finished**: Completed tasks that have been successfully finished.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Easily add, move, and delete tasks across different columns.
- **Description Editing**: Each task allows you to add and edit descriptions.
- **Local Storage**: Task descriptions are saved in local storage, ensuring data persistence even after refreshing the page.
